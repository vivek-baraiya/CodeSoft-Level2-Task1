            Ambedkar (14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist,
            economist, social reformer and political leader who headed the
            committee drafting.</p><p> the Constitution of India from the Constituent
            Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first
            cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the Dalit Buddhist
            movement after renouncing Hinduism. After graduating from
            Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied
            economics at Columbia University and the London School of Economics,
            receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was among a
            handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in
            the 1920s.[3] He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In
            his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. </p><p>His
            later life was marked by his political activities; he became
            involved in campaigning and negotiations for partition, publishing
            journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits,
            and contributing to the establishment of the state of India. In
            1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of
            Dalits.[4] In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian
            award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The salutation Jai
            Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him. He is also
            referred to by the nickname Babasaheb (BAH-bə SAH-hayb), meaning
            "Respected Father".</p>
